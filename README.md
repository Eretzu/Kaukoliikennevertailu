One part of SCI-project course. Server side setup, logic and programming by me. Google maps api and layout was done by others. 

Running needs installing of ruby on rails and possibly sqlite3. 

A lot of these files were autogenerated and the actual coding i did ended up being little. Instead i think this is a good example that I can setup a project with new technology and take responsibility for creating it in time.
